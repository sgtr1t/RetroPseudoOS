===============================================================================

Preface:

The general concept of RetroOS is that it has 2 diferent modes
1.User Interface(UI) mode
2.Command line mode

===============================================================================

Text:




1.The UI mode
The UI mode is pretty much the same as all the cellphones on the market these 
days(1990s): boot, and press a button to choose a function from the menu, and 
press a button to come back when finished.There are 7 different options on the
main menu: 
0.Shutdown; 
1.Add contacts; 
2.Show contacts; 
3.Search contacts;
4.Save to file; 
5.Reset/format; 
6.Commandline terminal; 
7.User manual. 

Press a number button to choose the very function you want to use, it's simple
as that.You SHOULDN'T forget to save to file after the modification has done,
or the modification will be lost as soon as you shutdown the phone. And every-
thing in the UI mode is easy enough that you will handle it very soon.





2.The Command line mode
The Command line mode is the very mode that makes RetroOS so special: you can
type in near any commands that runs on GNU/Linux or FreeBDS, and you will be
amazed by what you can do on this tiny little phone! Of course, it is an indie
OS, so we have a command shell that developed by our own: The RShell! You can 
run following commands on RShell:

1.exit
#to exit the command line mode and enter the UI mode.
2.shutdown
#to shutdown directly
3.purge
#to reset and format
4.burner
#to save the data to file
6.lscontact
#to show all the contacts by name
7.rm -rf/
#to smash the phone and purge all the system files (unreversible)
8.nmap
#to see the open port of this phone.
