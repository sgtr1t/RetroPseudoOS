Preface.

This is my design of a network communication between 2 processes.
I totally have no idea how this should work.
But I want to implement the network using the P2P model.
Maybe the RPvalue should have some more elements like IP address and portnum.



The Implementation of Anonymity.

Just to be sure, this implementation doesn't prevent someone else on the Inter-
net spying the communication. It just makes sure that either side takes no 
advantage of the other one. At least it prevent you from calling someone 
pretend to be the guy/girl you think it is. And if someone calls you with the 
right "callsign", at least you know it knows who you're. Let's say if you don't 
trust it for it claims to be, you can still hang up and have nothing to loose.

How to identify friendly or foe? Ask a question and wait for the password, if 
the password is correct then it's friendly, and it's a successful connection, 
if not, the connection should abort. The question should be random, and the 
correct password should depend on the target username and domain that the 
active side(let me call it "client") assumed. After a successul connection the 
"client" should give "server" it's identity, because it knows about "server", 
but "server" knows nothing about it's identity, neither side should take such 
advantage.



Further Details.

For every process running in every computer, the user and domain should be as
best as unique, and the IP address and portnum will be. Every process is both a
client and a server, every client has a list of contacts(other users) of its 
own. If not, then one will be able to create one, and then one can make further
contact. Once the connection is a success, the active side will send some basic
information about itself, let's say username and domain. Then on the passive 
side, if the username, domain, IP address, port numbers can be found stored in 
the database, then the user will be notified that one of it's contact want to
have a conversation, and user can choose to either answer the call or hang up.
If the database doesn't have the result, then it will notify the user the call
is from a stranger. The notification format is like this: "stranger/contact
user@domain from xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx(IP):xx(port) is requesting for connection, Yes
or No? (Y/N)".
